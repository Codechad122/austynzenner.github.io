  <p>My name is Austyn Zenner and I am studying user experience design. 
   I was going for computer science but that became very frusterating pretty quickly. This will be my third semester here at AAU.
  I used to go to Fort Hayes State University but it wasnt really the best option interms of schooling the programs werent the best.
  But I am hoping that this school will give the tools and resources in order to find a job before I graduate in 2 years.</p>
